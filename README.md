# Next.js router.push() Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where `router.push()` in Next.js does not correctly navigate between pages.  The issue is particularly noticeable when returning from a nested route to a parent route or when there is a rapid succession of route changes.  This may manifest as a blank page or the route not updating in the browser's address bar.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to the About page and click on 'Go back to Home'.  Observe if the route updates correctly. Repeat this several times in quick succession to observe the issue more reliably.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring proper handling of route changes and potentially adding error handling to gracefully manage unexpected behavior from `router.push()`. This example demonstrates how to perform such checks.
